# Hangman &#127918;
Hangman is a game in which the object is for one player to guess the letters of an unknown word before the player who knows the word creates a stick figure of a hanged man by drawing one line for each incorrect guess.

## Motivation &#127919;
The project is a warm-up exercise, and its primary goal is to test myself that I can move from theory and problem-solving to the implementation of complete projects.

## Functionality and Console Interface Menu &#128187;
1. The application offers to start a new game or exit the application at the start.
2. When starting a new game, a word is randomly selected, and the player begins the process of guessing it.
3. After each entered letter, the error counter and the current state of the gallows (drawn with ASCII characters) are displayed in the console.
4. After the game is over, the result (win or loss) is displayed, and we return to state #1 - offering to start a new game or exit the application.
